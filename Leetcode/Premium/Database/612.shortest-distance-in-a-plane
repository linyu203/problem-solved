https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane/



Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

SELECT  MIN(   ROUND ( SQRT( POWER(L.X-R.X,2) + POWER(L.Y-R.Y,2) ), 2) ) AS  shortest FROM POINT_2D L
JOIN POINT_2D R
ON L.X != R.X OR L.Y != R.Y
