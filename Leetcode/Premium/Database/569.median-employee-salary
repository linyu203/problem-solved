Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

select t1.Id as Id, t1.Company, t1.Salary
from Employee as t1 inner join Employee as t2
on t1.Company = t2.Company
group by t1.Id
having abs(sum(CASE when t2.Salary<t1.Salary then 1
                  when t2.Salary>t1.Salary then -1
                  when t2.Salary=t1.Salary and t2.Id<t1.Id then 1
                  when t2.Salary=t1.Salary and t2.Id>t1.Id then -1
                  else 0 end)) <= 1
order by t1.Company, t1.Salary, t1.Id


step 1: rank salary by company to build rank table
order by Company, Salary desc table
select @com_rank:=0
select @com:=0
step 2: build median rank table
if count(Id) is odd, then rank=floor(count(Id)/2)+1 is median
if count(Id) is even, then rank=count(Id)/2 and count(Id)/2+1 is median
step 3: join Employee, rank_table, median_rank table, select where rank=median_rank, to build final_table
step 4: from final table select min(Id) as Id, group by Company and Salary
select min(Id) as Id, Company, Salary
from
(select Employee.Id, Employee.Company, Employee.Salary
from Employee,

(select distinct Employee.Company, Employee.Salary
from Employee

join
(select Id, @com_rank:=if(@com = Company, @com_rank + 1, 1) as com_rank, @com := Company
from Employee,
(select @com_rank:=0) t,
(select @com:=0) r
order by Company, Salary desc, Id) rank_table
on Employee.Id=rank_table.Id

join
(select Company, floor(count(Id)/2)+1 as median_rank1, if(count(Id)%2=0,count(Id)/2,floor(count(Id)/2)+1) as median_rank2

group by Company, Salary
order by Company, Salary
