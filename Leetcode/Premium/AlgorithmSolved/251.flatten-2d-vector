251.flatten-2d-vector
Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.

Example:

Input: 2d vector =
[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.
