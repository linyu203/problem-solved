243.shortest-word-distance
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.


class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int res = INT_MAX,n=words.size();
        int widx1 = -1;
        int widx2 = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(words[i] == word1){
                widx1 = i;
            }else if(words[i] == word2){
                widx2 = i;
            }else{
                continue;
            }
            if(widx1>=0 && widx2>=0){
                res = min(res,abs(widx1-widx2));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
