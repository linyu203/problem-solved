469. Convex Polygon
https://leetcode.com/problems/convex-polygon/


Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

 

Note:

There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
 

Example 1:

[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]

Answer: True

Explanation:
Example 2:

[[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]

Answer: False

Explanation:
All triangles of a convex polygon should be walked in the same direction - either all clockwise, or all counterclockwise. And you need to skip midpoints on the same line. Performance is decent, it can be improved but I don't want to spend more time on it.
